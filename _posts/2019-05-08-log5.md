This week, use your research log space to do some writing in relation to your [Interpretive Prototype #2](https://jloan.github.io/e107v2/prototypes/2019/05/06/one-page-sabrina/). Here is a starting point question, but there certianly are others.

* What is your prototype one-page comic attempting to respond to? What do you find most intriguiing or intereating about *Sabrina* and how is your prototype potentailly responding to that?

For example, my own prototype is rooted in a couple of my favorite, or what I've found for me to be the most intriguing images from the book. This is one:

I've found myself intrigued by the use of empty spaces and rooms in the story. And by empty, I mean empty of people.

So, I want to make a prototype that maybe amplifies this emptiness or sense of absence in someway. 

Interestingly, I've also found that even when sequences/scenes have people in them, these also for me have a feeling of a certain sort "emptiness" or "abscence." NOt sure yet how to explain this but 

One idea I have is to reimagine a few scenes in the book that contain characters and conversations as actually being void of people. 

Not sure what it will amount to yet, but that's what I'm working with.
