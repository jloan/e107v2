## Prototyping About *Sabrina* (an Experiment)

We began the quarter with a reading and discussion of [*prototyping* as an approach](https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/prototype/) to doing work in the humanities like writing about literature. As a starting point for this work we prototyped a response to Kathleen Yancey's ["Writing in the 21st Century."](https://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/resource/2852)

The case I made to you about prototyping as part of our work in an Enlish class, as part of work in writing about literature was that prototyping encourages us to create/develop what does not yet exist, and in the work of writing about literarure, our challenge is pose and explore questions that may not yet exist. When we write about literature, our challenge is to go beyond simple summary of what happened in a particular work, but to create new and interesting queations to explore in relation to that work.

## Here's Your Challenge

#### Draw/Prototype a One-Page Comic in Response to *Sabrina*

This week we will be making a variation of Brunetti's "Week 9: Homework Assignment 9." In Brunetti's original assignment he asks us to draw a one-page story. Our variation will be to *draw a one-page prototype in response to Sabrina*.

The general guidelines will remain the same.

* You may use any layout and any number of panels that you wish.
* The final size should be 11X17 inches, even if reduced.
* Either horizontal or vertical format is OK.
* Include a title in the composition.
* Not counting black and white and grey, use at least one additional color. You may use as many additional colors as you like and apply them using whichever tools you feel comfortable using.

Successful one-page comics/prototypes will explore some key aspect or deminsion of *Sabrina* and attempt to evoking some of the book's complexity in an effort to generate new questions about the work.

Your one-page page protoype might explore any number of things in response to *Sabrina*, but here are a few ideas to get you started in your thinking:

* Compose a speculative "deleted scene" from Drnaso's book. Attempt to adhere as closely as you can to the stylistic choices made by Drnaso.
* Compose an "unseen" scene that develops a minor character that appears only briefly, or momentarily in the original book.
* Compose a variation of an existing scene by altering a key element of what makes it a comic. For example -- reimagine a scene from *Sabrina* in which you change the levels of realism and abstraction. Or reimagine a squence in the book using a differnt approach to pacing and time. Essentially, pick a cartooning/comics concept from McCloud or Brunetti and reimagine a key scene in *Sabrina* by substanively altering how Drnaso employed that element.
* Compose a McCloud-style one-page essay in respone to *Sabrina*. In other words, draw yourself as a character offering critical commentary on Drnaso's text.

These are just a handful of possibilities. There are no doubt others, and I encourage you to be as creative and experimental in your prototype as you're able.
