      <h2>Welcome to English 107</h2>

<p>English 107 is a course designed to explore writing about literature. This iteration of the course will  experiment with the possibilities of comics both as works of literature and as a medium capable of being put to use in the practice of <em>writing about literature</em>. A key question guiding our work this quarter will be: How flexible are genres (like the essay) and mediums (like comics) in performances of knowledge-making and academic work? </p>

<p>To expore this question we will engage in what I hope is a novel research/writing process -- <a href="https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/prototype/">prototyping</a>. </p>

<p>Together we will explore the possibilities of writing about literature using prototyping as our method of inquiry. To put this another way -- we&#39;ll be making comics as a way into writing about this genre of literature and we will also experiment with comics as a potentially essayist medium in its own right.</p>

<h2>How will we do this?</h2>

<p>Here is a thumbnail:</p>

<p>In the first half of the course, we will use Ivan Brunetti's <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300170993/cartooning"><em>Cartooning: Philosophy and Practice</em></a> and Scott McCloud's <a href="http://scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/"><em>Understanding Comics</em></a> as guides to prototyping our own graphic work. Simultaneously, we will read Nick Drnaso's <a href="https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/sabrina"><em>Sabrina</em></a>. We will use our own comics making to generate questions we might explore in the process of writing about Drnaso's novel.</p>

<p>In the second half of the course, we&#39;ll turn from our own experiments with comics and writing about them to reading a more &quot;traditional&quot; novel -- Octavia Butler's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower_(novel)"><em>Parable of the Sower</em></a>. We will take a big swing here, again using comics as prototypes for generating ideas and questions to explore in response to Buller's work. Finally, we will attempt to prototype the possibility of a <em>comic (or graphic) essay</em>. </p>

<!-- ## Welcome to English 107

English 107 is a course designed to explore writing about literature. This iteration of the course will  experiment with the possibilities of comics both as works of literature and as a medium capable of being put to use in the practice of *writing about literature*. A key question guiding our work this quarter will be: How flexible are genres (like the essay) and mediums (like comics) in performances of knowledge-making and academic work? 

To expore this question we will engage in what I hope is a novel research/writing process -- [prototyping](https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/prototype/). 

Together we will explore the possibilities of writing about literature using prototyping as our method of inquiry. To put this another way -- we'll be making comics as a way into writing about this genre of literature and we will also experiment with comics as a potentially essayist medium in its own right.

##How will we do this? 

Here's a thumbnail:

In the first half of the course, we'll use Ivan Brunetti's [*Cartooning: Philosophy and Practice*](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300170993/cartooning) and Scott McCloud's [*Understanding Comics*](http://scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/) as guides to prototyping our own graphic work. Simultaneously, we'll read Nick Drnaso's [*Sabrina*](https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/sabrina). We'll use our own comics making to generate questions we might explore in the process of writing about Drnaso's novel.

In the second half of the course, we'll turn from our own experiments with comics and writing about them to reading a more "traditional" novel -- Octavia Butler's [*Parable of the Sower*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower_(novel)). We'll take a big swing here. We'll again use comics as prototypes for generating ideas and questions to explore in response to Buller's work, and we'll attempt to prototype the possibility of a *comic (or graphic) essay*.-->
